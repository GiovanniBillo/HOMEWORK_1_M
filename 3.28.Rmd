# Estimating the required sample size to achieve a desired standard error for the sample proportion

##information
# The population proportion π may be near 0.50
# The desired standard error of the sample proportion is 0.04

##  required sample size
# The standard error of the sample proportion is given by the formula:
# SE(p̂) = sqrt(π * (1 - π) / n)
# Where:
# - p̂ is the sample proportion
# - π is the population proportion
# - n is the sample size

# we need to find the sample size n such that the standard error is 0.04
# Rearranging the formula, we get:
# n = π * (1 - π) / (SE(p̂)^2)

# Use a conservative estimate of the population proportion
pi <- 0.50 

# st error
se <- 0.04

# Calculate the required sample size
n <- pi * (1 - pi) / (se^2)

# Round up to the nearest integer
n_required <- ceiling(n)

## Print the result
cat("The required sample size n should be", n_required, 
    "to ensure the standard error of the sample proportion is 0.04 when the population proportion π may be near 0.50.")
